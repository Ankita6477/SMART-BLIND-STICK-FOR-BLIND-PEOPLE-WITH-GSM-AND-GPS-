# Smart Blind Stick – Project Report
The Smart Blind Stick with GSM and GPS is an assistive technology project designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate safely.
The stick integrates ultrasonic sensors, soil moisture sensors, and an LDR to detect obstacles, water/mud, and light conditions. It alerts the user through audio messages, vibration motors, and buzzers.
In case of emergency, the system uses a GSM module to send an SMS with GPS coordinates to a caretaker, enabling quick assistance.
This project aims to provide a low-cost, reliable, and portable solution for improving mobility and safety of blind and visually impaired people.

## 📌 Abstract
This project aims to assist visually impaired individuals with a smart stick that uses
**ultrasonic sensors, soil moisture sensors, LDR, GSM, and GPS** to detect obstacles,
identify water/mud, check light conditions, and send emergency SMS with live location.

## 🎯 Objectives
