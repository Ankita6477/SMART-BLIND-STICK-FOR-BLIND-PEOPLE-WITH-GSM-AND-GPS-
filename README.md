# SMART-BLIND-STICK-FOR-BLIND-PEOPLE-WITH-GSM-AND-GPS-
The Smart Blind Stick with GSM and GPS is an assistive technology project designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate safely.

The stick integrates ultrasonic sensors, soil moisture sensors, and an LDR to detect obstacles, water/mud, and light conditions. It alerts the user through audio messages, vibration motors, and buzzers.

In case of emergency, the system uses a GSM module to send an SMS with GPS coordinates to a caretaker, enabling quick assistance.

This project aims to provide a low-cost, reliable, and portable solution for improving mobility and safety of blind and visually impaired people.
